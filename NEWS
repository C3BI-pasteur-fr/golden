What's new in ?:

* Indexes files use now fixed size records. This breaks compatibility
  with old indexes, but allow the same files to be accessed on both 32
  and 64 bits hosts.

* New goldin '-d' flag, to specify an alternate flat files directory.
  NB: This change introduce some .dbx index file format modification,
  but compatibility with old structure is preserved.

What's new in 1.1:

* New golden '-c' flag, to check for entries existence without dumping
  them.

* Virtual databanks queries first support (.vix files).

* Support for large files (larger than 2 GB) on some 32 bits hosts.

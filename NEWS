What's new in 3.0

* goldin input can now be index files. Index files can be concatenated, sorted and purged.
  This allows parallelization of the indexation phase. Dued to this, we are now able again
  to index huge databases composed of a multitude of a small flat files (such as wgs).

What's new in 2.0:

* multiple queries in 1 sigle run for golden.

* new -f flag to pass names of files containing query values .

What's new in ?:

* Indexes files use now fixed size records. This breaks compatibility
  with old indexes, but allow the same files to be accessed on both 32
  and 64 bits hosts.

* New goldin '-d' flag, to specify an alternate flat files directory.
  NB: This change introduce some .dbx index file format modification,
  but compatibility with old structure is preserved.

What's new in 1.1:

* New golden '-c' flag, to check for entries existence without dumping
  them.

* Virtual databanks queries first support (.vix files).

* Support for large files (larger than 2 GB) on some 32 bits hosts.

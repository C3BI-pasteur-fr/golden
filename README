GOLDEN

Golden is a small databanks entries retriever. It searches and displays
entries on indexed databanks `flat' files.

This package currently contains the following programs :
  golden   ... Entries retriever.
  goldin   ... Indexes generator.

Queries/Indexes can be made using entry name, primary accession
numbers or even both (by default).

Currently supported formats : Genbank, Embl, Pir codata, and
assimiled.

golden functionnalities can also be exported to python (in order to be called from your python script).
In order to do that, you must of course have python installed on your machine.

These python "bindings" or "exports" were tested with python 2.7.

To install them, type:
sudo python setup.py install
